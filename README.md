# CTHub

A website that displays a bunch of discord servers. This theme is Classic Tetris but the same structure works for just about any collection of servers. Takes inspiration from Discord's student hubs, which really should be available to more widespread communities. Built using Create React App for the frontend, and expressjs/posgreSQL for the backend.

Run `npm start` in the root directory to start up the development client and run `npm start` in `./backend` to start up the server.
